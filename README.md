Links for parsing. In this section 
```
  "configcount" 
```
how many configs do you want to extract from this page
```
  "parsetoptobot"
```
if true parsing will done from top to bottom. 
- Use "true" for pages where new information placing at the top, like sites
- Use "false" for pages where new information placing at the

The following block of parameters is used to filter ip addresses by country. Because some genius makes servers(for example shadowsocks) in country with powerfull censorship, like Russia. You can exclude this ip from use if it belongs to a specific country.

```
"ipcheckserver"
```
Url to check if parsed IP address belongs to a country you don't want to connect to.

```
"ipcheckkey"
```
Key in json response
```
"ipcheckblacklist"
```
Mode for ipchecker - if "true" it blocks ip addresses when they match, if "false" it add only ip of given country
```
"ipcheckvalue"
```
Array of values in json response

It may look like
```
 "ipcheckserver":"https://ipinfo.io/",
 "ipcheckkey":"country",
 "ipcheckblacklist":true,
 "ipcheckvalue":[
    "RU",
    "CN"
  ]
```
or
```
 "ipcheckserver":"api.2ip.io/",
 "ipcheckkey":"country",
 "ipcheckblacklist":true,
 "ipcheckvalue":[
    "Russian Federation",
    "China"
  ]
```
or whitelist mode
```
 "ipcheckserver":"https://ipinfo.io/",
 "ipcheckkey":"country",
 "ipcheckblacklist":false,
 "ipcheckvalue":[
    "NL",
    "FR"
  ]
```
--------
I found a few servers wich can get simple request and send json response. To check it i used curl
```
curl https://ipinfo.io/1.2.3.4
curl api.2ip.io/1.2.3.4
curl https://geo.kamero.ai/api/geo?1.2.3.4
```


In output you can see how it returns country. For example
```
curl api.2ip.io/1.2.3.4
{
    "ip": "1.2.3.4",
    "city": "Moscow",
    "region": "Moscow",
    "country": "Russian Federation",
    "code": "RU",
    "emoji": ""
    "lat": "",
    "lon": "",
    "timezone": "Europe/Moscow",
    "asn": {
        "id": "",
        "name": "",
        "hosting": false
    },
    "signup": "Get more at 2ip.io/free"
}
```
If you know another servers like those two let me know
